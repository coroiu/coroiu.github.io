    "summary": "Recently graduated software engineer with lots of experience in full-stack development due to working through the majority of my studies. Passionate about software as my craftmanship - viewing clean code and architecture as an art. I humbly accept that I can never know everything, but still choose to have it as my dream. I love to ask questions, learn, teach, and when needed - speak up. My personal projects often include embedded programming and automation, but curiosity has taken me to other places as well - feel free to check out my github page. I am currently searching for challenges in new areas such as IoT (e.g. smart home devices), Automation and modern FinTech.",
