    "summary": "An engineer at heart who is passionate about software as my craftsmanship - viewing clean code and architecture as an art. I humbly accept that I can never know everything, but still choose to have it as my dream. I love to ask questions, learn, teach, and when needed - speak up. My personal projects often include embedded programming and automation, but curiosity has taken me to other places as well. My main goal and strength is the ability to understand the underlying nature of any problem. Distribution of this type of knowledge and the subsequent creation of a common understanding that it generates is, in my opinion, one of the main keys to success.",
